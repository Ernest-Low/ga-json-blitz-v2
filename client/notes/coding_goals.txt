Methods to go around writing the code


Render
- Maybe call a render function that will change the render positions every ~second or so
- Rebuild the entire screen from scratch is a way to do it?
> What about 2 seperate render functions - one for just rendering the entire screen, one for rendering animations that occur very often


Screen Management $("#blackscreen")
- Using a variable to remember which screen is active?
- Maybe ??? Using a constant black screen to hide / show elements? (Control Z axis)
- https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp
- View width: 80vw. View Height: 95vh


!! Buttons !!
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_text_buttons.asp
- Probably better than adding text and a button next to it
- Add forced width to make it fill the entire width? (width 100%)
- Highlight to show its selected (good for future arrowkey play)
- How about
    > Slight depression of button on hover
    > Button flashes when pressed to show selected


Progress Bar:

> Potential usage for HP/MP bar


Flexbox Overflow
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47446258/css-flexbox-overflow-100-width-elements
- overflow: hidden;
> Can't seem to get rid of that small space below? Currently covered up by #663a31 (might be an image import fit into div problem)


Javascript Array Methods instead of FOR loops
- Avoid using for loop when possible to loop through arrays
> Utilise javascript array methods.


Audio (Music / Sounds)
- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_audio_play.asp
- var audio = new Audio('audio_file.mp3');
- audio.play
- audio.pause (to stop)


Fade effect
- fadeOut(time)
- fadeIn -> Pull the black screen, fade it out
- Utilise CSS animation maybe?


Animation Typing effect:
- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/
- Can ignore the blink-caret if it doesn't look nice
> Good to learn keyframe animation
> https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp
    - Animate: Leveling effect / exp progress bar


JSON Files for datastoring
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp
> Try to change all the data_files to json format instead of saving them as .js files.
> Having trouble importing json files, have to figure it out


GIFS

> Find some other way?


setTimeout !~! Bad , change to global clock.
- Keeps counting even if the window is out of focus (nothing happens), which may cause events to happen ahead of time.
> Potentially change it such that it will keep recalling itself, decreasing a 'timer' variable, which is used to get events running instead.
! Confirmed, global clock needed. Will need to remove all setTimeout in favor of a single ticking clock to count
> Eg: At time of check, check what count is the clock. Set to work when the clock is at/above a count of ticks.


Deep Copies of Objects:
- JSON.parse(JSON.stringify( OBJECT ))
- Important to know between shallow copies / deep copies


Absolute Positioning
- Hardstuck the main screens to the page



Tooltips
- Check back on old project
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp


Objects using IDs as Keys
- data_files can be rewritten, using IDs.
- Change the arrays so they're more more intuitive

Change objects stored in players (items / spells) to be objects and not references
- Allows individual changing & modification of those objects
- Probably better than always referencing back to the data
