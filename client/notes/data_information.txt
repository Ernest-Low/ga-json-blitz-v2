Monsters

Player exp calculation - Up to level 10?
Player Level         : 1    2    3    4    5    6     7     8     9     10
Player Levels EXP req: 100  230  390  580  800  1050  1330  1640  1980  2350
15n^2 + 85n

Monster Exp Calculation
Monsters lvl from 1 - 15
Exp per monster: Monster level * 10 * (4 to 6) + (20 to 40)
Monster level:     1          2           3           4           5           6           7           8           9           10
Monster exp:   100 - 118  139 - 172   184 - 232   235 - 298   292 - 370   355 - 448   424 - 532   499 - 622   580 - 718   667 - 820
3n^2 + 30n + 67 to  3n^2 + 45n + 70

Monster Damage Calculation
Damage window = (damage - damage_spill) to (damage + damage_spill)
Critical chance (150% damage) - Base of 3%.
> Critical chance increases by 1% per monster level above the player

Level scaling
Future addition!? Need to think of a calculation that will determine an enemy's power.


Items

Misc Item IDs: 1 - 1000
Weapon Item IDs: 1001 - 2000
Armor Item IDs: 2001 - 3000         (Extra)
Accessories Item IDs: 3001 - 4000   (Extra)
Consumables:    4001 - 5000

Potential Speed set - Progress bar for who moves (Boot icon?!) - Maybe multiple turns

Weapons
Weapon Info: Damage: Base Damage, weapon_spill means the diceroll variance. Eg: Weapon Damage 5, spill of 2, means the base damage is 5-2 to 5+2 (3 - 7)
Critical Chance: Base of 5%. Increased by skills / items. (Math.ceil(Math.random()* 100)
Critical hits do 150% damage (maybe increase in future via effects) - Round down to integer

Attributes = [str,agi,int,hp,mp]
Type: melee, ranged, magic
Melee higher base damage
Ranged higher damage spill, higher scaling
Magic no damage (for now?), adds more int / mana

Item Drop table
Currently 2 item types only: common / uncommon
Common loot table of monster level -2 to monster level of itemlevel (monster level 4 will drop level 2 - 4 loot)
Rare loot table of monster level -4 to monster level of itemlevel (monster level 7 will drop level 3 - 7 loot)
    - 3% (For now) per fight for rare items
    - 10% (For now) per monster for common items?





Buffs / Debuffs as extra

Icons:
(fist) : Attribute buff
(Skull) : Debuffs (curse)
(blood drop(s)): Taking damage per turn
(swirly) : Stunned
(Sword) : Attack buff (short duration / single use)
(Shield) : Defense Buff (short duration / single use)
(boot with wings) : Speed stat affected

Icons flush to the left (to be cleaner)
Per start of player turn, remove 1 duration from each of player buffs / debuffs
Per end of player turn, proc each debuff / damage proc

If stunned, they can still pick their action, but if it's not an item, it won't work.
Silence debuff makes them unable to use spells (under curse)
