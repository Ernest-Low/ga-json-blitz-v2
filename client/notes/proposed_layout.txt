Battle Screen
Action States: 
> Attack / Spells / Items
- Attack (just basic attack using weapondamage calculation)
- Skills (consume mp, attack using abilities)
    > Name of skill - hover for tooltip (icon maybe)
- Items (open consumables window) (might be scrollable https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/making-a-div-vertically-scrollable-using-css/ )\
    > Name of item - hover for tooltip (icon maybe)
> Run (Abandon current zone run, return to start of zone)
    - Lose all current exp
    - Lose % of gold (probably half)

Find a place for messagebox? (find a beter spot) (or replace action box with messages (click to progress next?))
Background: encompass player / enemy / messagebox? (black opacity message box? Utilise alpha channel background color not opacity)

> Try the text typewriter option to put in the actionbox?
> Action buttons can look nicer - shove text to left and make narrow buttons?

Idea: Popup a box (not alert) to notify after each battle, for next action:

- Also need to design inventory system
> Equipment
    > Show each equipped item (Weapon) > Press again to get a window of equippable items (include equipped item with an 'EQUIPPED' next to it?)
> Consumables
    > Recovery items to be usable between battles
> Skills
    > Read up on each individual ability and their effect
