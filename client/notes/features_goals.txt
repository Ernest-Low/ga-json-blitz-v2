A List of features I would like to add / need to add.




Storyboard
- Need to think up a story(?)
> Like the 'yada yada brave adventurer / hero please save our kingdom' at start, then a 'muahahaha demon king will rule the world' kinda thing


(Half)  Zones
- Do enemy zones dictate what level enemies are in them?
- Enemy zones are objects with keyvalues?
- How many enemies for a player to get out of a zone
- Shop scenery?
- Kingdom far-zoom scenery?
- Scaling enemies based on zone (variables and constructors)


Leveling stats screen
> Hit [Stats] or something and can press buttons to add to stats
    - Confirm button for confirmation
    - Back to go back to previous screen


(Done)  Spells / Skills
Scaling off Str, Agi, Int
- Some increase an attribute for a few turns?
- Others just deal damage
- Debuffs / Buffs


Shop
- Plain text in a screen for now (Popup or dedicated screen?)
- Possibly have an image serve as background (shop scenery)


Enemy targeting
> For scaling, assign enemy target as a variable.
    - Adds possiblity for changing enemy target in future (multiple enemies)
    - Also save the enemy in an array probably
    - Idea: Click enemy target to target them


(Done)    HP Bars
- Everyone to have hp bar above their head
- ? Should enemies have their hp bars listed in a grid too?
    > Probably only when targeting them
-- On hit, have a large red number flash to show the damage inflicted over the character
